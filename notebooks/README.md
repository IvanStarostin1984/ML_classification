# Demo notebooks

This directory contains short notebooks demonstrating the pipelines and dataset used in this project. They are meant as interactive examples rather than part of the core code.

You can run the notebooks online without installing anything locally:

- **Google Colab:** open a notebook on GitHub and click the "Open in Colab" button.
- **Binder:** use the Binder badge below to launch a temporary environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

These notebooks assume the dataset has been downloaded via `scripts/download_data.py` or that you upload it manually when prompted.
