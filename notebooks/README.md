# Interactive notebooks

This folder is for short Jupyter demos of the package. They are not required
for training the models but can be handy for quick experiments.

```bash
# Ensure the Kaggle dataset is downloaded first
python scripts/download_data.py

# Then start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

You can also open the notebooks directly in Google Colab via the GitHub link.
